# Biosynthesis (Forge)

This is an under-development Minecraft Forge mod that adds a new unique virus like plant that will spread and grow over time. The plant can not be destroyed by normal means and will forcefully spread to other blocks or mutate itself into bigger clumps.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/someramsey/biosynthesis/releases)
2. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your `.minecraft/mods` folder
3. Launch Minecraft with the Forge profile

The plant currently does not naturally generate, launch a new world and use the `/setblock biosynthesis:vessel_head` to start the spread of the plant.
